This is the MVVM version of the Notes demo I created in my Build Your First Xamarin Forms Appn talk.

In the talk, I created the Notes app by following the tutorial at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/single-page?pivots=windows. I then modified the app to use MVVM and this is the result of that.
